I am a California State University San Marcos graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. This site marks the beginning of my professional career. 

In this space I will be sharing my learning experience as the Summer 2019 Front-End intern at <a href="https://planning.center"> Planning Center</a>, including relevant samples and code snippets relating to the workspace. I look forward to working with (and learning from) the talented team at Planning Center.
