One day, I was challenged to create a 3D model of PiCO, <a href="https://planning.center">Planning Center</a>'s robot mascot. Since Blender is a free and open source 3D creation tool, it seemed like the obvious choice for the job.

Planning Center's Javascript guru Travis Arnold brought him into the webs. <a href="https://twitter.com/souporserious">Check out his Twitter</a> for more goodness.
