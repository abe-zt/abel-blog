My first task at <a href="https://planning.center">Planning Center</a> was issued by <a href="http://willdossantos.com/">Will Dos Santos</a>, Planing center's designer and illustrator extrordinaire. The task was to add _subtle_ animations to the home page's existing static image. 

Here's a sample of the animations I added. They were achieved with a little CSS - mainly @keyframes.

<iframe height="500" style="display: flex; width:100%" scrolling="yes" title="Hero Image 2.0" src="//codepen.io/abe-zt/embed/preview/ydbvvJ/?height=415&theme-id=0&default-tab=css,result" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">
  See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/abe-zt/pen/ydbvvJ/'>Hero Image 2.0</a> by Abel
  (<a href='https://codepen.io/abe-zt'>@abe-zt</a>) on <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

I have plans to add a more detailed post on keyframe animations in the near future.
